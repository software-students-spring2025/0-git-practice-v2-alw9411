## The Article
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra> Wikipedia: Edsger W. Dijkstra </a>

## Why it caught my eye
I find Dijkstra's article interesting because I've come across his work already in Basic Algorithms. Notably, I encountered his algorithm for finding the least costly way to traverse a graph. 

## A few interesting details
A fascinating tidbit is that when he had to state his profession, "programmer" was not a valid answer according to the authorities of the Netherlands. I also find it interesting that he frequently did not choose to use references to others' work.


## Comment by Gilad Spitzer 
Dijkstra was not only a pioneer in computer science, known for developing the shortest path algorithm that bears his name, but he was also a strong advocate for structured programming. His influential 1968 letter, "Go To Statement Considered Harmful," sparked a major shift in programming practices by promoting clearer and more maintainable code structures. Additionally, Dijkstra was awarded the Turing Award in 1972 in recognition of his fundamental contributions to algorithm design and programming methodology, solidifying his legacy in the field of computer science.
