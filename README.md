## The Article
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra> Wikipedia: Edsger W. Dijkstra </a>

## Why it caught my eye
I find Dijkstra's article interesting because I've come across his work already in Basic Algorithms. Notably, I encountered his algorithm for finding the least costly way to traverse a graph. 

## A few interesting details
A fascinating tidbit is that when he had to state his profession, "programmer" was not a valid answer according to the authorities of the Netherlands. I also find it interesting that he frequently did not choose to use references to others' work.
